        Reverse the order of words in the string `s`, where words are separated by spaces.
        Any leading, trailing, or multiple intermediate spaces should be reduced to a single space.

        Instead of manually parsing character by character, we can:
          1. Use str.split() to split on any whitespace (automatically removes extra spaces).
          2. Reverse the resulting list of words.
          3. Join them with a single space.

        This runs in O(n) time and uses minimal extra code.
