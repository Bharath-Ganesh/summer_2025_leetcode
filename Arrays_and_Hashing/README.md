## Pattern Recognition

- Common patterns observed across array/hashing problems:
  1. Using hash map for O(1) lookup
  2. Using array as hash table
  3. Frequency counting
  4. Two-pass vs one-pass solutions

## Tips and Tricks

1. Always consider edge cases:
   - Empty array
   - Single element array
   - Duplicate elements
   - Negative numbers
2. Space-Time tradeoffs:
   - When to use extra space for better time complexity
   - When to modify input array in-place

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting to handle edge cases
2. Not considering the input constraints
3. Unnecessary sorting when hash map would suffice
4. Inefficient space usage
