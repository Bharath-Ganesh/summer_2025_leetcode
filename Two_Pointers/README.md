## Pattern Recognition

- Common patterns in two pointer problems:
  1. Converging pointers from ends
  2. Fast/slow pointer for cycle detection
  3. Same direction with different speeds
  4. Partition arrays in-place

## Tips and Tricks

1. Edge Cases to Consider:
   - Empty/Single element arrays
   - Equal elements
   - Sorted vs unsorted input
   - Negative numbers
2. Optimization Techniques:
   - When to use extra space
   - In-place modifications
   - Early termination conditions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not handling edge cases
2. Incorrect pointer movement
3. Off-by-one errors
4. Not considering duplicates
5. Unnecessary space usage
