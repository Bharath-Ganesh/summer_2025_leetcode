# Dynamic Programming

## Overview

This section covers two main types of dynamic programming problems:

1. 1D Dynamic Programming
2. 2D Dynamic Programming

Each type has its own directory with specific problems and learning materials.

## Common DP Concepts

- Problem-Solving Approach:
  - Identify subproblems
  - Define state
  - Write recurrence relation
  - Determine base cases
- Implementation Methods:
  - Top-down (Memoization)
  - Bottom-up (Tabulation)
  - Space optimization
- Common Patterns:
  - Fibonacci-style
  - Longest/Shortest sequences
  - Counting problems
  - Optimization problems

## Directory Structure

```
Dynamic_Programming/
├── 1D/                # One-dimensional DP problems
└── 2D/                # Two-dimensional DP problems
```

## Problem Distribution

- 1D DP: 20 problems
- 2D DP: 15 problems

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic 1D problems
   - Fibonacci sequence
   - Climbing stairs
   - House robber
2. Move to intermediate 1D
   - Longest sequences
   - Coin change
   - Substring problems
3. Progress to 2D problems
   - Grid traversal
   - Matrix chain multiplication
   - Edit distance

## Common Patterns Across DP Problems

1. State definition
2. Transition formulation
3. Base case handling
4. Space optimization
5. Path reconstruction

## General Tips

1. Always solve small examples first
2. Draw state transition diagram
3. Consider space optimization
4. Handle edge cases
5. Test with small inputs

## Reference Materials

- State Transition Diagrams
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis
- Optimization Techniques
- Common DP Patterns
