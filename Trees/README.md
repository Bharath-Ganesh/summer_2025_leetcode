# Trees

## Overview

This section covers three main types of tree data structures:

1. Binary Trees
2. Binary Search Trees (BST)
3. Tries

Each type has its own directory with specific problems and learning materials.

## Common Tree Concepts

- Tree Traversals:
  - Inorder (Left-Root-Right)
  - Preorder (Root-Left-Right)
  - Postorder (Left-Right-Root)
  - Level Order (BFS)
- Tree Properties:
  - Height and Depth
  - Balanced vs Unbalanced
  - Complete vs Perfect
  - Full Binary Tree
- Implementation Techniques:
  - Recursion
  - Iteration
  - Queue/Stack based approaches

## Directory Structure

```
Trees/
├── Binary_Tree/         # General binary tree problems
├── Binary_Search_Tree/  # BST specific problems
└── Trie/               # Prefix tree problems
```

## Problem Distribution

- Binary Tree: 15 problems
- Binary Search Tree: 10 problems
- Trie: 5 problems

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic Binary Tree traversals
2. Move to Binary Search Tree operations
3. Finally tackle Trie problems

## Common Patterns Across Tree Problems

1. DFS vs BFS approach selection
2. Recursive vs Iterative solutions
3. Parent pointer usage
4. Level-wise processing
5. Path tracking

## General Tips

1. Always clarify the tree type
2. Consider both recursive and iterative approaches
3. Pay attention to space complexity
4. Handle edge cases (null nodes, single node)
5. Consider using helper functions

## Reference Materials

- Tree Traversal Visualizations
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis
- Common Tree Operations
- Tree Balance Concepts

See specific README files in each subdirectory for detailed problem lists and concepts.
