# Trie (Prefix Tree)

## Key Concepts

- Trie Structure:
  - Root node
  - Children nodes (usually 26 for lowercase letters)
  - End of word marker
- Basic Operations:
  - Insert
  - Search
  - StartsWith (Prefix search)
  - Delete
- Applications:
  - Autocomplete
  - Spell checker
  - IP routing tables
  - Phone directories
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis
