# Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Key Concepts

- BST Properties:
  - Left subtree < Root < Right subtree
  - Inorder traversal gives sorted array
  - Search/Insert/Delete in O(h) time
- BST Operations:
  - Search
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Successor/Predecessor
- BST Balancing:
  - AVL Trees
  - Red-Black Trees
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis

## Pattern Recognition

- Common patterns in BST problems:
  1. BST property utilization
  2. Inorder traversal
  3. Range-based validation
  4. Tree modification
  5. Successor/Predecessor finding

## Tips and Tricks

1. BST Properties Usage:
   - Inorder traversal gives sorted array
   - Use BST property for efficient search
   - Range validation
2. Implementation Techniques:
