# Heap / Priority Queue

## Key Concepts

- Heap Types:
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
  - Binary Heap
  - D-ary Heap
- Basic Operations:
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Extract Min/Max: O(log n)
  - Peek: O(1)
  - Heapify: O(n)
- Applications:
  - Priority scheduling
  - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra)
  - Median finding
  - K-way merging
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis
