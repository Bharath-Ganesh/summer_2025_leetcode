# Graphs

## Overview

This section covers three main approaches to graph problems:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Advanced Graph Algorithms

Each approach has its own directory with specific problems and learning materials.

## Common Graph Concepts

- Graph Representations:
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List
  - Edge List
- Graph Types:
  - Directed vs Undirected
  - Weighted vs Unweighted
  - Cyclic vs Acyclic
  - Connected vs Disconnected
- Basic Operations:
  - Traversal
  - Path Finding
  - Cycle Detection
  - Topological Sort

## Directory Structure

## Problem Distribution

- BFS: 10 problems
- DFS: 10 problems
- Advanced: 10 problems

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
2. Move to path finding and cycle detection
3. Finally tackle advanced algorithms:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Union Find
   - Minimum Spanning Tree
   - Topological Sort

## Common Patterns Across Graph Problems

1. Traversal choice (BFS vs DFS)
2. Visited node tracking
3. Path recording
4. Cycle detection
5. Connected components

## General Tips

1. Choose appropriate graph representation
2. Consider space-time tradeoffs
3. Handle disconnected components
4. Consider edge cases:
   - Empty graph
   - Single node
   - Cycles
   - Disconnected components

## Reference Materials

- Graph Representation Visualizations
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis
- Common Graph Operations
- Advanced Algorithm Implementations
